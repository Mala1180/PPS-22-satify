## Sprint Goal

The goals of this sprint are:

- Terminate DPLL algorithm
- Provide a richer DSL
- Provide some basic problems as examples

There will be the second pre-release of the project permitting to solve
SAT problem also using the examples provided.

## Deadline

The deadline for this sprint is 28/08/2023.

## Sprint Review

The sprint terminates with all tasks completed except for the problem instances.

A prototype is released, which permits inserting a more complex input using the DSL.
It is possible to solve the SAT problem using the DPLL, and also importing a problem in DIMACS format.

Some tasks on code and package organization are demanded to the next sprint because of the lack of time.

## Sprint Retrospective

We discovered a problem in the Tseitin Transformation that was corrected in this sprint.

We thought that the use of monads could be useful to handle all the tree data
structures, but the change would complicate the design, therefore, in the next Sprint we will
evaluate the pros and cons of an eventual implementation.
