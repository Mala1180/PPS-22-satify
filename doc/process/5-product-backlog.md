## Sprint Goal

The goals of this sprint are:

- Providing the user a way to get all the solutions incrementally or all at once.
- Addition of some basic functionalities to the DSL like the comments.

There will be the final release of the project containing all functionalities.

## Deadline

The deadline for this sprint is 25/09/2023.

## Sprint Review

In this last sprint, all the tasks have been completed. 
Being the last sprint of the project, the team dedicated extra time to the documentation and to general refactoring.
Every member of the team, beyond its tasks, 
has refactored little parts of the software in order to check even the smallest details.

The sprint terminates in time, and the first release of Satify has been carried out. 

## Sprint Retrospective

During this sprint, some complex tasks have been removed from the backlog
because it was not possible to complete them in time. 
The release is stable, but it is still possible to encounter some memory
problems due to the stack size.
