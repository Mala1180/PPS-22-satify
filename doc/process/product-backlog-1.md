## Sprint Goal

The goals of this sprint are:

- Setup the project
- Domain understanding
- In case of extra time, start the implementation

There are no potentially shippable artifacts in this sprint.

## Deadline

The deadline for this sprint is 28/07/2023.

## Sprint Review

The sprint goals were achieved with no problems. We had some extra time to start the implementation.

## Sprint Retrospective

We realised that some Sprint Task was not sufficiently expanded. To complete a Task often we had to do more than a
single Pull Request/Feature. Moreover, not all the estimations were perfectly precise, but that didn't hurt so much.
