# Requirements

KEEP IN MIND: a requirement should be validatable, by definition.
Everything that pertains “how the system works and affects
output/environment” must become a requirement, even if it was not explicitly
elicited by a stakeholder (it is the developer’s duty to inform the stakeholder
later, and seek for acceptance)

## Business requirements 

The goal of our project is to develop a SAT Solver that allows the user to check the satisfiability of a logical expression.
Our mission is to implement it in a pure functional way using the Scala programming language, and it's flexibility.
Satify is a tool that can be used by anyone who needs to check the satisfiability of a logical expression, but also to convert 
the logical expression in CNF form.

The user can use the tool in two ways:
- by using the text field to insert the input formula.
- selecting an example from the list provided by the tool.
