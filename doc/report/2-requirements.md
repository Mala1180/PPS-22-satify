# Requirements

KEEP IN MIND: a requirement should be validatable, by definition.
Everything that pertains “how the system works and affects
output/environment” must become a requirement, even if it was not explicitly
elicited by a stakeholder (it is the developer’s duty to inform the stakeholder
later, and seek for acceptance)
1) business, 2) modello di dominio, 3) funzionali [ 3.1) utente, e 3.2) di sistema ], 4) non funzionali, 5) di implementazione
## Business requirements 

The goal of our project is to develop a SAT Solver that allows the user to check the satisfiability of a logical expression.
Our mission is to implement it in a pure functional way using the Scala programming language, and it's flexibility.
Satify is a tool that can be used by anyone who needs to check the satisfiability of a logical expression, but also to convert 
the logical expression in CNF form. There is also the possibility to simplify this CNF form and to use the solver with some examples. 
The examples are N-Queens, Coloring Graph, Nurse Scheduling.
