## Tseitin Algorithm - Alberto Paganelli

Initially, not having sufficient knowledge, I spent some time understanding the algorithm and its intermediate phases so
that I could approach the development in an incremental way.

I had assumed that it would take me more time to understand the algorithm, but its parts are relatively
simple. The transformation consists of the division of the formula into clauses, a part of the introduction of new
variables and a rewriting of the initial formula through these last ones in CNF.

## Task review

We start requiring two code reviews for each Pull Request, but we noticed that this approach was not possible during all
the project development due to the fact that not all the team members were available to do the code review.
For this reason we decided to momentarily reduce the number of code reviews to one but only when the PRs were not
fundamental. We took this decision in order to avoid to block the work of the other team members.
