##Tseitin Algorithm - Alberto Paganelli

Initially, not having sufficient knowledge, I spent some time understanding the algorithm and its intermediate phases so that I
could approach the development in an incremental way.

I had assumed that it would take me more time to understand the algorithm, but its sub-parts are relatively
simple. The transformation consists in the division of the formula into sub-clauses, a part of introduction of new
variables and a rewriting of the initial formula through these last ones in CNF.
