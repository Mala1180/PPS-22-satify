# Methodology


## SCRUM

The methodology adopted during the application design has been AGILE, expecially using the SCRUM technique.

This technique involves the definition of time windows called Sprints, where each developer within the team carries out the tasks assigned to him during the Sprint Planning, to then discuss their implementation in the phase of Sprint Review, 

In order to organize the work in the best possible way, it has been decided that the period of a single Sprint had to be of two weeks, after which a meeting of variable duration would take place.

Initially we decided to dedicate the first Sprint to the project setup and for the definition of the used technologies and framerowks that we'd go to use later.

Only after the first setup Stream we decided how to divide the work at best, without overwhelm or privilege any team member and trying to divide the work type of each one. Moreover, for each Sprint Review, a potential artifact could be potentially delivered.

Furthermore, after a first phase of alignment at the Sprint Review, each member had to discuss how they approached to the modeling, implementation and successive tasks assigned to him.

## Trello

The tasks have been divided thanks to the using of Trello, which allowed us to define a first glance view of how the work is going across the Sprint, for each member of the team. This was possible dragging the card of each task. 


## Git Flow

An important choice for the team has been the use of Git Flow as development Workflow.
During each Sprint, each member made Pull Requests when a task was completed, in order to get supervised from the other team member in any moment they thought right. 

Each member had the possibility to get one or two code reviews, so that the merge was allowed in a more controlled way, drastically reducing bugs which could slow down other member's work.

Each Sprint Planning and Sprint Review had a variable length of (?)
